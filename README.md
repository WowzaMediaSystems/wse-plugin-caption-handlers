# Wowza Caption Handlers
The **Caption Handlers** module for [Wowza Streaming Engine™ media server software](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-engine) enables you to generate CEA608/708 or WebVTT subtitles for live streams using the Azure speech to text service, or the Whisper ASR system.

## Prerequisites
* Wowza Streaming Engine™ 4.9.4 or later is required.
* Java 21.
* For the Azure Speech to Text module, you will also need an Azure account with the Speech service enabled.
* For the Whisper module, you will need a Whisper server configured.

## Usage
The easiest way to test this module is to use the included docker compose file. This will start a Wowza Streaming Engine instance with the modules installed and configured to use Azure Speech Services or Whisper to create the captions.

## Build instructions
* Clone repo to local filesystem.
* Update `wseLibDir` variable in the `gradle.properties` file to point to local _Wowza Streaming Engine_ `lib` folder.
* Run `./gradlew build` to build the jar file.

## Configuration
